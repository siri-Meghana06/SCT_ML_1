House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
Project Description
This project predicts house prices based on selected features such as living area size, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. Using a Linear Regression model, it analyzes historical housing data and provides predictions for new houses. The model is evaluated using R² Score and RMSE to measure its performance.

Project Highlights
Built a predictive model using Linear Regression.
Selected important features from the dataset for training.
Visualized Actual vs Predicted prices for performance analysis.
Evaluated model accuracy using R² Score and RMSE.
Added functionality to predict prices for new house inputs.
